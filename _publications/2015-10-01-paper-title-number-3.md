excerpt: 'Recent advances have explored extending knockoff methods to complex, high-dimensional data using deep generative models. \textbf{Deep Generative Knockoffs} leverage models such as variational autoencoders, GANs, or normalizing flows to approximate the joint distribution of the original features and generate synthetic knockoff copies.'
